# Design notebook for week ending December 7, 2014

## Description

This week we worked on documentation and adding dependencies and recurrences
to our language. We were struggling with the complicated notion of adding 
the functionality to our language that allowed users to create recurrences that
depend on other tasks with recurrences. We decided that, due to the time constraints 
of the class, we would allow users only to have either a dependency or a recurrence
for a given task, but not both. My work this week (along with some final language
design issues) has been focused on the wrap-up work for our project. I am
in the process of putting together our final write-up and figuring out how 
a user would download and use our lanugage and plugin for the first time 
so that I can write this up and put it in the readme. I looked a little
bit at the syntax highlighting for the sublime plug-in as well. 

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**
The most pressing issue for our project right now is implementing our final 
design for recurrences and dependencies. 

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**
Are there any features that you wish we had put into our language? Does the final 
design seem like a reasonably functional tool for task management?

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**
I spent about 7 hours on work this week and about 2 hours on reflecting in this
notebook and on the critique. My work is described above and we continued
having Nick work on the sublime plugin and Michael is working on the parser. 

## Post-critique summary
My critique focused on the concerns we had about the syntax of our 
language.

## Post-critique reflection
I think that we will not have time to alter our syntax in any way, 
but we will definitely be creating a readme with instructions. If
we had much more time, I think that our goal would have been to 
provide users with an optional, more verbose/clear syntax that 
would allow users to have a more customizable experience with 
their task management.
