# Design notebook for week ending November 16, 2014

## Description

This week we worked on creating a concrete idea for the actual implementation of 
our language. We documented this in detail in the text document in the project
folder. We also did research into what Python libraries would be helpful
in our implementation. Originally we had thought we would be using Python as
a host language for this DSL, but later in the week after looking at libraries
for case classes we are now thinking of switching to Scala. My part this week
was to help with the documentation and to begin work on the parsing elements 
of our language with the pyparsing library. We have a much more concrete idea
of what we will be doing once we choose a host language to stick with. 

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

We have simplified our language quite a bit in order to meet the prototype 
deadline, so we will have to think more about how our language will work
with various types of recurrences and other complications. We are also concerned 
about which language we will be using (described more below). We have
been going back and forth on Scala/Python and need to make a decision that is
best for the project. 

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

We are still struggling with the decision regarding using Python vs. Scala
as the host language. The use of case classes is not as clean in Python as 
it is in Scala, so we recently changed our minds about working in Python
and switched to Scala. However, we have not thrown working in Python
completely out the window since we are still so early in the project. 

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

I spent about 8 hours on the project this week. We met as a group to work on and discuss
the project for 6 hours total this week and I spent 2 hours on this journal entry and the 
critque reflection added to last week's journal. A lot of the work was spent together so
that we could come to an agreement on what our final language implementation should be
and so that we could finish the language implementation document, but we worked individually
on fleshing out the document. We also divided the project into three separate parts to 
work on for the prototype: syntax, semantics, and interplay with sublime.
