# Design notebook for week ending November 2, 2014

## Description

This week we discussed a lot of different options that would work for our 
domain of Project and Task Management. One of the most important decisions
that we had to make this week was how to narrow our focus for our DSL within
this domain so that we had both a reasonable and interesting project that
we could expand on as time allows. With this in mind, we decided to narrow
our project to a language concerned with the time dependencies of tasks
that make up a project. Some open questions include the exact way in which
we want to have the user specify input and exactly how we will output
the dependency model. We think that we are going to use python as our
host language, but we still need to do some further language design
in order have a more concrete idea. 

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

The most pressing issue for our project right now is deciding how to have the
user specify input in order to make the language as useful and intuitive as 
possible. We also need to decide how we will have the program compute 
dependencies and how we will ultimately display a dependency model as output.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

It would be good to know what they think about the scope of our project as well
as the usefulness, or what they think would be intuitive in terms of inputing
tasks and receiving a dependency model. 

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

This week we spent time on the design of our language and what functionality 
it should have. I probably spent a little less than nine 
hours this week. We shared our work effectively as a team in order to get the
project plan and design finished.
