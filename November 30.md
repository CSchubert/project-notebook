# Design notebook for week ending November 30, 2014

## Description

This week was largely spent on break. We did not meet to work on our project after doing
user-testing in class. We learned a lot from user testing (described in our evaluation
document). I spent most of my out of class time this week contributing to the
evaluation.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

The most pressing issue is the addition of recurrences and dependencies. 
Since we have a stable foundation, we should be able to implement this as 
desired with constant testing.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

One of the biggest questions we have is concerning the syntax. We like the 
succinct syntax of our language, but for new users (and also just a personal 
preference for others) the succinct nature of the language can be confusing
and/or annoying. We did consider a more verbose syntax, but we are not sure
if we want to switch to that completely. We also considered giving the user
the option between the two types of input, but that may be confusing/difficult/
or just unecessary. 

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

I spent about 3.5 hours on this project this week. It was break, so this is not as much
as usual. I spent about two hours on the evaluation document, and the rest split between
this notebook entry and my critique. 

## Post-critique summary

We currently do not have a critique from Nov. 25th that I can summarize/reflect on.
